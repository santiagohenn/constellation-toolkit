# constellation-toolkit
A set of constellation.tools to perform constellation.tools of coverage areas served by N Multiple Low-Earth Orbit Satellites

## Dependencies

You need to have the orekit dataset installed in your computer. You can clone it from [HERE](https://github.com/santiagohenn/orekit-data.git) or search the latest version in the [official site](https://orekit.org).

## Basic usage

The easiest approach is to modify the configuration file with the scenario configurations and run the app:

```java
String configurationsPath = "C:/experiments/config.properties";
ConstellationCoverageComputer app = new ConstellationCoverageComputer(configurationsPath);
app.run();
```

An example properties file with explanations is provided in this repo. Here are some formats for the inputs required.

#### Satellite constellation

A CSV file containing a satellite on each line, with no headers. Each line contains the following information, in this order:

```tex
Elements' date (ISO 8601), Semi-major axis (m), Eccentricity,Inclination (째),RAAN (째),Arg. of Periapsis (째),True Anomaly (째)
```
_Example:_

```csv
2025-01-01T16:00:00.000,6978135,0,45,250,0,220
2025-01-01T16:00:00.000,6978135,0,45,250,0,240
2025-01-01T16:00:00.000,6978135,0,45,250,0,260
2025-01-01T16:00:00.000,6978135,0,45,250,0,280
```

#### Polygon (ROI) File

A CSV file containing coordinates that define the Region of Interest (ROI), on each line coordinates are given in ```latitude,longitude``` format, in degrees.

_Example:_

```csv
-24.492,-67.165
-24.492,-66.743
-24.492,-66.322
...
```

Important: Do not use self-intersecting polygons. Use clock-wise order for the coordinates according to the surface you want to enclose. Points will be placed at surface-height according to the WGS84 Earth model. Huge polygons (e.g. a complete Earth hemisphere) might yield strange results. 

## Output format

The tool outputs several files. The coverage output file depicts a time series where the first column is the epoch time in milliseconds and the next columns are the percentage of ROI access by at-least ```1,2,...,N``` satellites. 

_example:_

```csv

```

Coverage results are also given in JSON format, both for the entire constellation and each satellite. If geographic outputs are enabled more JSON files are generated with coordinates over time and a particular snapshot tiem, provided this is enabled in the configuration file. 

### Constellation hash

Each constellation is assigned a unique hash based on the orbital elements of its satellites. This hash is included in the output files for identification purposes. The hashing process works as follows:

- For each satellite, all orbital elements except the semi-major axis are multiplied by 1000 (the semi-major axis remains unchanged).
- The integer part of each element is taken.
- The elements are ordered as: semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity, RAAN, argument of periapsis, and true anomaly.
- The integer values are concatenated into a single string for each satellite, with no separators.
- All satellite strings are sorted in natural (lexicographical) order and concatenated into one long string.
- This final string is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm to produce the constellation hash.



## Advanced usage

Most of the configurations can be override in runtime. This is useful to do scenario optimization, parameter exploration, etc.

Change the output path:

```java
app.setOutputPath(outputPath);
```

Changing the constellation from a file:

```java
List<Satellite> satelliteList = Utils.satellitesFromFile(ConstellationFilePath);
app.setSatelliteList(satelliteList);
```
Chaging a single satellite element(s):

```java
List<Satellite> satelliteList = app.getSatelliteList();
satelliteList.get(0).getElements().setInclination(98.888);
satelliteList.get(0).getElements().setSemiMajorAxis(6771000);
```
_The satellite index corresponds to it's zero-based position on the constellation file_

Change the ROI:

```java
List<double[]> ROI = FileUtils.file2DoubleList("polygon_path");
app.setROI(ROI);
```

You can generate polygon that enclose spherical caps on the Earth and set it as the scenario ROI:

```java
List<double[]> ROI = GeographicTools.computeSphericalCap(centerLatDegrees, centerLonDegrees, roiSphericalRadius, roiSegments);
app.setROI(ROI);
```

If you need to compute some Geographic parameters, GeograpicTools has some useful methods. E.g. to compute the surface (in meters squared):

```java
GeographicTools geographicTools = new GeographicTools();
double roiSurface = geographicTools.computeNonEuclideanSurface(ROI);
```
